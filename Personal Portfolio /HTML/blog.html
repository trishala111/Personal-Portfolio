    <h1>Impact and Use of Technology In Our Daily Life.</h1>

    <p>Technology is about more than just gadgets and gizmos. Technology's role and impact in both our personal and
      professional lives is expanding all the time. Understanding how people shape technology and how technology shapes
      people's interactions with each other and the natural world is important not only for those who research, develop,
      and implement new technologies but also for all those people and organizations who use them. Technology is
      concerned with understanding how knowledge is creatively applied to organized tasks involving people and machines
      in order to achieve long-term goals.

      In this pandemic technology is only the way we contact our friends and family. It helps us to learn and share
      different new things from websites which has made our life easier. Technology entails doing things in a systematic
      manner. Technology is about taking action to meet a human need rather than simply understanding how the natural
      world works, which is the goal of science. The development of the microscope. It employs far more than scientific
      knowledge, incorporating values as well as facts, practical craft knowledge as well as theoretical knowledge. The
      iPod is an example of how the physics of packing so much music into such a small device combined with creative
      design to create an iconic must-have accessory. It addresses the intended and unintended interactions between
      products (machines, devices, artifacts) and the people and systems who create, use, or are affected by them via
      various processes. Many people enjoy drinking coffee, which they usually do in a coffee shop. That coffee could
      have come from trees that were bred specifically for higher yields. The harvested coffee beans will be transported
      around the world to be processed and packaged before being distributed to shops, which will then make the cup of
      coffee in a polystyrene cup that was manufactured for the purpose but will then be discarded, and so on. Every
      decision we make is based on and feeds a highly interdependent and far-reaching way of life in which some have a
      lot and some have a lot less. Technology is a hands-on, do-it-yourself profession that requires people to be
      skilled in many areas, including engineering, communication, design, development, innovating, managing,
      manufacturing, modeling, and systems thinking. However, technology also provides us with a variety of products
      that can be used for good or ill, or where the benefits are debatable, and the processes involved in producing and
      using technology mean that we should all be concerned about whether it provides us and everyone else with a
      sustainable future.
